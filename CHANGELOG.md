# Changes for Newsboat

## Unreleased

### Added

- Dependency on Boost

### Changed

    (https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/issues/602)

### Deprecated
### Removed

- Build dependency on Perl (#6)

### Fixed

- When used with Newsblur, Newsboat will check on startup if cookie-cache exists
  or can be created, because integration doesn't work without cookies (#13)

## 2.10.1 - 2017-09-22

### Added

- Documentation for automatic migration from Newsbeuter

## 2.10 - 2017-09-20

This is what Newsbeuter 2.10 should have been. Newsboat continues Newsbeuter's
version numbering to show that we are a spiritual continuation, not a separate
project.
